dumb tool i made because i was boread listening to mac demarco and wanted to checkout [cobraCLI](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)

## install
```bash
go get github.com/goosetacob/asthtc
```

## usage
```bash
$ asthtc aesthetic goosetacob
~ g o o s e t a c o b ~

$ asthtc aesthetic los angeles
~ l o s a n g e l e s ~
```
```bash
$ asthtc voweless goosetacob
gstcb

$ asthtc voweless los angeles
lsngls
```

## todo
- write some tests
- auto dump into pbcopy (or xsel for linux) when in CLI
- figure out autocomplete for this
- spin up a server in a conatiner to make GET requests
- something actually useful?
